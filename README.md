## DateValidation


</div>

### Description

In general this is a function, that validates an entered date. It sets the output-date one day after the input-date and verifies if there is a month or year-break and even handles leap-years.

I made it because I needed a way to point dates where the end can't be before the beginning, which may happen thru bad inputs. In this way the end-date is always in the future of the beginning-date.
 
### More Info
 
The function accepts dates only. This could be the first day of your hollidays!

In this archive is a complete vb6-project. The function itselve is in the 'DateValidation'-Module and can be completely extracted. The form is just an example how it works.

I've done a bit commenting. I think it should be enough.

The function returns a date-value. In this case the last day of your hollidays!
